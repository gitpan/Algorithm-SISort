NAME
    Algorithm::SISort - Select And Insert sorting algorithm

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a sorting algorithm I saw in BIT 28 (1988) by
    István Beck and Stein Krogdahl. This implementation is mainly intended to
    try out the Inline module by Brian Ingerson. The algorithm is a
    combination of *Straight Insertion Sort* and *Selection Sort*. While
    *Insertion Sort* and *Selection Sort* both are of complexity O(n**2),
    *Select and Insert Sort* should have complexity O(n**1.5).

    For more usage information, read the Algorithm::SISort pod
    documentation.

INSTALLING
    Installing this module is as easy as unpacking the tar archive, cd'ing
    to the extracted directory, and running:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install
   
   And if you are using the CPAN shell, it's is as easy as going:
      perl -MCPAN -e shell
      install Algorithm::SISort

   Note, that this module requires Inline v. 0.40 or newer. The perl
   Makefile.PL step will detect if any components are missing and issue a
   warning, and CPAN should download install any dependencies automatically.
