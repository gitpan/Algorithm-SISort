Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::SISort.

0.14  Sat Mar 02 19:00 GMT 2003
        - Added information on how to install the package to the 
          README file.
        - Added a reference to rt.cpan.org to the documentation
	- Made Makefile.PL fallback to ExtUtils::MakeMaker if
          Inline::MakeMaker is not available. Hopefully allowing
          for seamless installation or upgrade of Inline when installing
          through the CPAN shell.

        - Moved SISort.pm into the root of the package to

        - Updated my email address in the documentation
